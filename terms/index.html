              <p>
                By downloading or using ChartsGPT, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the app.
              </p>

              <h2>1. Use of the app</h2>
              <p>
                You may use ChartsGPT for lawful personal or business use. You are responsible for your device security and account
                settings on your app store platform.
              </p>

              <h2>2. No financial advice</h2>
              <p>
                ChartsGPT provides automated analysis and educational insights only. It is not investment, financial, legal, or tax advice.
                Markets are risky and outputs can be wrong or incomplete. You are solely responsible for your trading and investment
                decisions.
              </p>

              <h2>3. Subscriptions and billing</h2>

                ChartsGPT may offer optional auto-renewing Pro subscriptions through Apple In-App Purchase.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Billing</strong>: Apple charges your Apple ID account after purchase confirmation.</li>

              </ul>

              <h2>4. Your content</h2>
              <p>
                You retain rights to content you provide (such as chart images). You grant us permission to process that content only as
                needed to operate app features.
